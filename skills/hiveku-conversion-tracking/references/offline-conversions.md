# Reference: Deals to the ad platform (offline conversion upload)

This file covers the lane that takes a closed deal, a won call, or a commerce order in Hiveku and
pushes it back to the ad platform as an offline conversion, so Smart Bidding optimises toward
revenue instead of toward form fills. Load it when a client says "we closed real money from Google
Ads and the platform does not show it", "push our CRM sales back to Google / Meta", "close the loop
on click to sale", when you are asked to turn offline conversions on, when you are wiring or
auditing a conversion action or a Bing goal, or when a batch came back `skipped` or `failed`. It
assumes you already ran `account_context_get` and know the click-side chain (embed, form ledger,
DNI) from the main skill. This is a refusal-first system: the pipeline returns reasons, it does not
throw, and the job is almost always to read a reason and clear it, not to retry.

Two different tool surfaces reach the platforms, and confusing them is the newest setup error:

- **The declared lane** - ten `marketing_offline_conversions_*` tools (section 13). It DISCOVERS
  conversions from the CRM, forms and Shopify, dates and validates them, and pushes them to
  google_ads, microsoft_ads or meta_ads. Enabling it always lands in validate-only; going live is a
  human dashboard flip that no tool performs.
- **The hand-upload tool** - `ppc_offline_conversion_upload` (section 10). Rows YOU supply, Google
  Ads only, two-step confirm. It never discovers anything.

---

## 1. The two lanes

**Lane A - CRM and commerce.** Sources `crm_deal_won`, `form_lead`, `shopify_order`. A Hiveku record
is matched back to a click id stored on the contact and uploaded with a value.

**Lane B - voice and calls.** A tracked call attributed through the DNI pool session. The click id
comes from `voice_pool_sessions` (gclid/gbraid/wbraid/fbclid/msclkid/ttclid plus utm, referrer,
landing url, ga_client_id, ad_consent), not from the contact's own columns.

Lane A dies on **missing click ids and missing value**; Lane B dies on **missing capture at swap
time**. Read Lane B with `marketing_call_attribution_breakdown` and `marketing_call_attribution_list`;
read Lane A's form half with `marketing_form_conversion_audit`.

Lane B has its own doctor: **`voice_call_tracking_diagnose`** returns seven checks
(`ok | warn | fail | unknown` each) plus an ORDERED `fix_first` list - read `fix_first`, and an
`unknown` is NOT a pass. **`voice_call_tracking_outbox`** then shows the upload rows one at a time
with each `error_code` translated (filter `status: 'failed'` first; an empty result means either
nothing was ever enqueued - a tracking problem - or everything uploaded cleanly).
`analytics_channel_scorecard`'s call reconciliation causes and `voice_diagnose_setup`
(`blocking_issues[]`) remain the channel-level views. The calls reference, section 9, carries the
family in depth, including `voice_call_tracking_setup`, the wiring tool whose `did_count` field
spends money.

---

## 2. The two hard gates

Nothing uploads unless BOTH are true. There is no implicit default anywhere in this system.

**Gate 1 - the account opted in.** The offline-conversion setting must be enabled, a deliberate
per-account switch. A new account is OFF, and every candidate then returns `not_opted_in` with zero
API calls made. Not a bug and not a permissions error: somebody has to decide this account sends
customer conversion data to an ad platform. For Lane A (deals, forms, orders)
`marketing_offline_conversions_opt_in({ enabled: true, lookback_days?, note? })` flips it - and it
ALWAYS lands in validate-only mode: payloads are proven against the platform and NOTHING is
recorded until a human goes live in the dashboard. The go-live flip is withheld from agents
(`validate_only: false` is a 403). Opting in on an account a human already took live preserves live
mode - it never silently un-arms - and the response `note` states the actual mode: read it back to
the user verbatim. For Lane B, the CALL lane's tenant opt-in
(`voice_tenant_config.conversion_upload_enabled`) is one of the steps `voice_call_tracking_setup`
wires - still a deliberate, confirmed decision, never a silent side effect of "fixing tracking".

**Gate 2 - a designated conversion action the connection's own ad account owns.** A mapping row must
exist for that (connection, source) pair with `enabled = true`, naming a conversion action an
operator explicitly designated, and that action must belong to the ad account behind that connection.
Ownership is verified, not assumed: borrowing an action from a sibling MCC account or the agency's
own account fails. The mapping is written with `marketing_offline_conversions_designate` after
reading candidates from `marketing_offline_conversion_actions_list({ connection_id })`; Hiveku
NEVER creates a conversion action - designation points at one that already exists on the platform.

Both gates are per (account, connection, source). Turning on `crm_deal_won` for Google does **not**
turn on `form_lead` for Google and turns on nothing for Microsoft. Each pair is its own decision and
its own confirmation.

---

## 3. What `conversion_action` MEANS on each platform

The most common setup error: same field name, a different kind of string per platform.

| Platform | `conversion_action` is | Shape | Read it from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `google_ads` | a ConversionAction **resource name** | `customers/1234567890/conversionActions/987654321` | `ppc_conversion_actions_list` |
| `microsoft_ads` | the offline conversion **goal NAME**, exact match against an existing OfflineConversionGoal | `Hiveku Offline Deal Won` | `ppc_bing_conversion_goal_list` |
| `meta_ads` | the CAPI **event name** | `Lead`, `Purchase` | `ppc_meta_custom_conversions` |

Google wants the id-bearing resource name, not the display name. Pasting the human name fails
ownership verification rather than string matching, so it returns `conversion_action_not_owned` and
reads confusingly. On that reason, check the SHAPE first.

Microsoft matches on the goal's name string, so **a rename in the Microsoft Advertising UI silently
breaks a working mapping.** If a Microsoft lane stopped working, list goals with
`ppc_bing_conversion_goal_list` and compare the name character for character before anything else.

Meta: **Hiveku sends only the `fbc` parameter.** Enhanced matching (hashed email or phone) is refused
outright with `policy_no_pii`. Never promise a client Meta offline conversions matched on customer
email through this lane.

---

## 4. Windows, guards, exact numbers

| Guard | Value | On violation |
|---|---|---|
| Click window: google 90d, microsoft 90d | 90 days | `stale_click` |
| Click window: meta 7d | 7 days | `stale_click`, plus `meta_stale` on Meta |
| Platform not in the lane (linkedin_ads, tiktok_ads) | refused at designate, before any window check | no upload path exists; their conversion ingest is their own (section 11) |
| Import max age (conversion age) | 63 days, Google's horizon | `conversion_too_old` |
| Minimum upload delay | 6 hours after the conversion | `TOO_RECENT_*` |
| Maximum conversion value | 1,000,000 | `value_above_max`, **REFUSED, never clamped** |
| Chunk size | 200 rows | rows split, status per row |

**The 6-hour floor is a floor, not a suggestion.** A deal closed 40 minutes ago returns
`TOO_RECENT_*` and does not go. Honest answer to "can Smart Bidding see this today": earliest six
hours after the win, and you should be batching daily anyway. Daily batching is a standing job, not
a habit: build it as a scheduled workflow (`workflow_` tools, or `/hiveku:automate`) so Meta's
7-day window stops eating conversions the week someone is on vacation - the interactive two-step
confirm below still governs any batch YOU run by hand.

**Value above 1,000,000 is refused, not clamped.** A misplaced decimal, a value in cents, or a JPY
amount uploaded as USD gets a hard refusal instead of a capped upload. Correct: a clamped 1,000,000
conversion would poison tROAS for weeks. Look for a unit error before assuming a real megadeal.

Row statuses: `queued | validated | uploaded | failed | skipped`. `skipped` carries a refusal reason
and is where you spend your time. `failed` is a platform-side error on a row that passed our gates.
`validated` is a validate-only outcome: the payload was proven against the platform and NOT recorded;
those rows upload for real only after a human goes live and `marketing_offline_conversions_requeue`
re-arms them.

---

## 5. Dating the click (the whole ballgame)

A conversion is only acceptable if it ties to a click, and the click must be dated so the platform
can verify the conversion did not precede it and fell inside the window. A wrong timestamp is worse
than no upload.

**1. Pick the click id. CURRENT touch wins over first touch**, and within Google
`gclid` > `gbraid` > `wbraid`. `crm_contacts.gclid` and `.click_ids` hold CURRENT;
`.original_gclid` / `.original_click_ids` hold the write-once FIRST touch. The lane uses current
deliberately: the click that actually preceded the win is the more recent one.

**2. Date it from `source_history`.** Take the LATEST `crm_contacts.source_history[]` entry carrying
that exact click id value. `source_history` is the append-only dated audit trail and **the only place
in the entire system that knows WHEN a click happened.** Neither `gclid` nor `click_ids` carries a
timestamp. No matching entry means the CRM cannot date this click.

**3. Fall back to `contact.created_at`.** It is at or BEFORE any click on that contact, so standing
in for the click instant it dates the click EARLIER than it really was, which **over-states the
click's age**. An over-stated age can only push a row past a window boundary, never pull one back
inside, so the fallback **refuses more rows than it strictly should, never fewer.** A genuinely
in-window click can be rejected as `stale_click` purely because the contact record is old. Deliberate
trade: a false refusal costs one conversion, a false acceptance corrupts a live bidding system.

**`updated_at` is explicitly rejected as a dating proxy.** Any unrelated edit (a tag, a note, a
workflow touch) moves it, so it would date the click as whenever somebody last opened the contact.
Never substitute it, never offer it as a workaround.

**Read `dated_by` on every row.** A batch dominated by the `created_at` fallback says
`source_history` is thin here: a click-side capture problem (embed freshness, consent gate,
localStorage unavailable), not an upload problem. And a `stale_click` refusal does not prove the
click was old, only that a fallback-dated contact predates it. Check `dated_by` first.

---

## 6. Dating the deal win

**`crm_deals` has no `won_at` column.** There is no single field. Priority order:

1. An audit-log `crm.deal.won` event. The real thing: a recorded transition.
2. The latest `stage_history.entered_at`. Dates the last stage entry, which is the win only if the
   win was the last stage change.
3. `updated_at`, **last resort and flagged as such.** Same weakness as above.

With the 63-day horizon and the 6-hour floor, an `updated_at`-dated deal can fall outside the window
because nobody touched the record for two months, or be refused as `conversion_in_future` /
`conversion_precedes_click` because an edit happened after the fact. Those two reasons together
strongly suggest `updated_at` dating: check whether the account produces `crm.deal.won` audit events
at all.

**"Won" is the account's own vocabulary.** No hardcoded `'won'` string: the pipeline reads that
account's deal statuses flagged `is_won`. An account with no `is_won` status yields **zero candidate
deals**, not a guessed set. This is the most confusing ticket in the product: offline conversions on,
mapping valid, connection healthy, preview empty. Before debugging anything else, confirm at least
one deal status carries `is_won`. If none does, that is the fix, and it is a one-time CRM settings
change, not a pipeline issue.

---

## 7. Ad consent is a TRI-STATE

Not a boolean: `false` = explicitly opted OUT (suppress); `true` = granted (upload); `null` = **no
signal was ever collected**, which is not a denial.

**Only the form-lead collector sets it.** Not an oversight: consent is a browser-side signal, and a
form submission is the only one of these events happening in a browser where the signal exists. A
deal closed by a salesperson on the phone, and a Shopify order placed through another checkout, leave
ad consent undefined **by design**.

Resolution is per contact across every submission that contact ever made, **newest explicit signal
wins**: denied in March, accepted in July resolves to accepted; all nulls resolves to null. An
explicit denial suppresses `google_ads`, `microsoft_ads` and `meta_ads`, but **not GA4**. The reason
is `ad_consent_denied`.

Never treat `null` as denial and quietly drop rows, and never treat `null` as consent where the
client has said otherwise. If asked whether uploading a deal with no consent signal is compliant, the
technical answer is "no consent signal was ever collected for that contact, because the conversion
did not originate in a browser session we instrumented"; the compliance answer is their counsel's.

---

## 8. Every refusal reason and what to actually do

Returned, never thrown, and shown verbatim in the dry-run preview. Work them in this order: gates,
identity, dating, value. Reasoning for the gate and dating rows is in sections 2, 5 and 6.

| Reason | Do this |
|---|---|
| `not_opted_in` | Account switch off. Explain the data-sharing decision and get a yes FIRST. Lane A: `marketing_offline_conversions_opt_in({ enabled: true })` - lands in validate-only, nothing recorded; going live is a human dashboard step. Call lane: `voice_call_tracking_setup` wires the tenant opt-in - dry_run first, and never as a workaround for the yes. |
| `source_not_designated` | No mapping row for this (connection, source). `marketing_offline_conversion_actions_list({ connection_id })`, then `marketing_offline_conversions_designate` against an EXISTING action, confirmed. |
| `mapping_disabled` | `enabled = false`. Find out who turned it off, then re-designate with `enabled: true` deliberately. |
| `unsupported_platform` | No upload lane there (the declared lane covers google_ads, microsoft_ads, meta_ads). Do not retry. |
| `no_connection` | Reconnect, then `ppc_digest` for sync freshness. |
| `conversion_action_not_owned` | Belongs to another ad account. On Google check it is a resource name, not a display name. Re-pick from `ppc_conversion_actions_list`. |
| `conversion_action_changed` | Renamed, deleted or swapped platform-side. Re-designate. On Microsoft, usually a goal rename. |
| `connection_account_mismatch` | Connection points elsewhere now. Rebuild the mapping against the current ad account. |
| `no_click_id` | Upstream capture problem, not an upload problem. Run `analytics_diagnose_tracking` and `marketing_form_conversion_audit`; check whether the click id sat in the landing URL but never reached `utm_params`. |
| `no_hashed_identifier` | None exists. Not fixable per row. |
| `no_contact` | Deal has no linked contact. Fix CRM linkage. |
| `ad_consent_denied` | Explicit opt-out. Do NOT override. Leave it. |
| `policy_no_pii` | Meta enhanced match_mode requested; Meta is fbc-only. Drop enhanced matching. |
| `match_mode_changed` | Changed since queueing. Re-validate the mapping, re-run. |
| `stale_click` | Outside the window. Check `dated_by` first: on a `created_at`-fallback row this may be a false refusal from an old contact record. |
| `meta_stale` | Meta's 7-day horizon. Only cadence fixes it: batch Meta daily, never weekly. |
| `stale_conversion` / `conversion_too_old` | Past 63 days, unrecoverable. Change cadence so it stops recurring. |
| `conversion_precedes_click` | Bad dating on one side. Check for `updated_at` dating. |
| `conversion_in_future` | Clock or timezone error, or an `updated_at`-dated deal edited later. Check the offset. |
| `TOO_RECENT_*` | Under the 6-hour floor. Wait and re-run. Never a config problem. |
| `no_value` | No amount on the deal. Either they populate deal values, or ROAS reporting is off the table. |
| `invalid_value` | Non-numeric or malformed. Data hygiene. |
| `value_above_max` | Over 1,000,000, REFUSED not clamped. Look for cents-vs-dollars or a currency mixup first. |
| `already_enqueued` | Idempotency working. Do not force. Check the earlier row's status. |
| `error` | Genuine failure. Read the row detail; never blanket-retry a batch on this alone. |

---

## 9. Dispatch-time re-checks

The gates are not evaluated once. A row that passed the preview is checked AGAIN at dispatch, which
is why the `_changed` reasons exist at all (`conversion_action_changed`, `match_mode_changed`)
alongside `connection_account_mismatch` and `already_enqueued`. Between preview and dispatch somebody
can rename a Microsoft goal, delete a Google action, reconnect under a different customer id, or
another path can enqueue the same conversion.

- **A clean preview is not a guarantee.** Report previewed rows as "eligible", never "will upload".
- **Do not re-run a whole batch because some rows came back `_changed`.** Fix the mapping, then
  re-run. `already_enqueued` protects rows that landed, but a forced re-run muddies the audit trail.
- **Do not change anything platform-side between preview and confirm.** If a conversion action was
  edited after previewing, throw the preview away and preview again.

---

## 10. `ppc_offline_conversion_upload` in depth

The hand-upload tool: rows YOU assemble, not rows the lane discovered. **Google Ads only.** Against
a Microsoft, Meta, LinkedIn or TikTok connection it returns a wrong-platform error, **not an empty
result** - Microsoft and Meta are reached by the declared lane (section 13), never by this tool. An
empty-looking response on the wrong platform is never "nothing matched": read the error.

**The two-step confirm is the entire safety model.**
1. **First call, no `confirm`.** Returns a dry-run preview with `requires_confirm: true` and
   **uploads nothing**. It carries per-row refusal reasons verbatim.
2. **Second call, IDENTICAL arguments plus `confirm: true`.** This one uploads.

Identical arguments matter: changing the entry set between calls means you confirmed a preview the
human never saw, so dropping refused rows or fixing a value is a NEW preview and a new confirmation.
Never skip step one to save a turn, and never confirm without showing the human the eligible count,
total value and currency, the conversion action being written to, and the refusal breakdown. This is
money entering a live bidding system.

**Required argument shapes**, per entry:
- **`gclid`** (preferred) **or `order_id`.** Prefer `gclid` whenever a click id exists; `order_id` is
  the commerce join key.
- **`conversion_date_time`** as the exact string `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+HH:MM'`. The offset is
  **required**. No `T` separator, no `Z`. A wrong offset is the quiet cause of
  `conversion_precedes_click` on a same-day win.
- **`conversion_value`** - numeric, under 1,000,000.
- **`currency_code`** - ISO code, matching what the deal value actually is.

**The Ads UI requirement nothing in Hiveku can fix.** The conversion action must exist AND be
configured with source **Upload** in the Google Ads UI (Conversions, New conversion, **Import**). A
WEBPAGE-source action will not accept uploaded clicks, and no tool flips an existing action's source:
it is set at creation. If the designated action was created as a website conversion, create a new
Import-source action with `ppc_google_conversion_actions` (`type_: 'UPLOAD_CLICKS'`, or
`UPLOAD_CALLS` for the call lane) and re-designate the mapping to it.

**Partial failures.** Results come back **per row**; the batch is not atomic. Expect a mix of
`uploaded`, `skipped` with a reason, and `failed`. Report all three counts. Never describe 40 uploads
and 12 skips as "the upload failed", and never as "done" without naming the 12.

`ppc_customer_match_upload` (audience lists) is under the same strict two-step contract: preview,
show, confirm.

---

## 11. Conversion action and goal CRUD, per platform

### Google

- **`ppc_conversion_actions_list`** (Google only). id, name, status ENABLED / REMOVED / HIDDEN,
  category, counting type ONE_PER_CLICK / MANY_PER_CLICK, attribution model, lookback windows, value
  settings, type, origin, `primary_for_goal`. Where you get the resource name for a mapping.
- **`ppc_conversion_tracking_status`** (Google only). `action_count`, `enabled_count`,
  `silent_count`, per-action list, `warnings[]`. It now sees dead tags (a date-segmented query
  returns no row for a zero-conversion action, so the old single query omitted exactly the actions
  worth reporting), so a **higher** `enabled_count` / `silent_count` than last month is the fix
  working, not a regression. Read the two numbers correctly: **`conversions` counts only actions in
  the Conversions column that Smart Bidding optimises on; `all_conversions` counts everything, and
  silence is judged on `all_conversions`.** `conversions: 0, all_conversions: 50` is a secondary
  action recording fine, NOT a dead tag.
- **`ppc_google_conversion_actions`** (create, get-tag, update):
 - **`type_` carries a trailing underscore.** `WEBPAGE | UPLOAD_CLICKS | UPLOAD_CALLS | AD_CALL |
    WEBSITE_CALL | CLICK_TO_CALL`. This lane wants `UPLOAD_CLICKS` (deals) or `UPLOAD_CALLS` (calls).
 - `include_in_conversions_optimization: false` makes it **reporting-only, excluded from Smart
    Bidding.** True if offline deals should change bidding, false to observe without disturbing a
    working campaign. Say which you chose.
 - `phone_call_duration_seconds`: calls shorter than this record **NOTHING**. Set it to the
    account's real qualification threshold; set too low, it is the same threshold that makes a
    12-second wrong number a conversion.
 - **`always_use_default_value: true` FLATTENS every conversion to one number and destroys
    transaction-level revenue reporting.** tROAS then bids against a constant, indistinguishable from
    having no value-based bidding while looking like you do. Never set it on a revenue lane; if a
    client asks for it, confirm explicitly.

### Microsoft (Bing)

- **`ppc_bing_conversion_tracking_status`** - UET tags and install state, goals and recording state,
  `ready_for_conversion_bidding`, plain-language verdict. **Run it BEFORE switching any campaign to
  max_conversions, target_cpa or target_roas**: the bidding tool refuses without a bidding-eligible
  goal, so checking first saves a failed change.
- **`ppc_bing_uet_tag_list`** / **`ppc_bing_uet_tag_create`** - a tag not "recording" means the site
  snippet is missing or broken, the **number one reason a Bing account reports zero conversions**.
- **`ppc_bing_conversion_goal_list`** - the exact goal NAME a Microsoft mapping needs.
- **`ppc_bing_conversion_goal_create`** - `goal_type` is `url | event | duration |
  pages_viewed_per_visit`; **`tag_id` required on all of them**; `url` needs `url_expression`;
  `event` needs at least one of category / action / label; and **`goal_category` is required on url
  and event goals** (omitting it is the usual reason the call bounces).

### Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok

- **`ppc_meta_custom_conversions`** - what exists, with `last_fired_time` **per conversion** (a
  pixel-grain check cannot tell a dead LEAD from a live PURCHASE, since one pixel serves every
  conversion). An empty list means no CUSTOM conversions are defined, **not** a failed read; a failed
  read returns `readability` / `coverage_gap` and never an empty list.
- **`ppc_meta_conversion_volume`** - `attributed_conversions`, deliberately not merged with
  `last_fired_time`: fired recently with zero attributed is a **media finding**, not a tracking
  failure, and merging them would hide that.
- **`ppc_linkedin_conversions`** / **`ppc_tiktok_conversions`** read configured conversions. Neither
  is covered by the declared lane (google_ads, microsoft_ads, meta_ads only), and
  `ppc_offline_conversion_upload` is Google-only; LinkedIn and TikTok conversion ingest is their
  own `ppc_linkedin_conversions` / `ppc_tiktok_conversions` operations, per the PPC skill's
  `paid-social-and-bing.md`.
- **`ppc_digest`** before trusting any platform number: it warns on connections stale by more than 25
  hours. "The platform shows 3" against a connection that synced two days ago is not yet a finding.

---

## 12. Worked play: "we closed 15 deals from Google Ads last month and the platform shows 3, fix it"

Do not start uploading. Find out which of five problems this is.

**0. Context and freshness.** `account_context_get`, then `ppc_digest`. If the Google connection is
stale by more than 25 hours, the "3" may simply be unsynced.

**1. Platform verdict, once.** `analytics_channel_scorecard` (needs a custom domain). Slow: call it
ONCE, never in a loop. Relay the Google row's `headline` **verbatim**, it carries the number that
makes the problem undeniable. Read `hiveku_recorded` vs `platform_recorded`, `missing`,
`how_we_know`, `how_to_fix`, `conversion_actions[]`. Two traps:
**`conversion_actions_window_days` is fixed at 30 and does not follow `days`**, so never compare it
against a 60-day request; **`conversions_last_30_days: null` means we could not read it, never zero.**

**2. Which half is broken?** Web-side (the conversion never fired) or offline-side (the deal never
uploaded). The scorecard's call reconciliation causes name the offline ones: `upload_disabled |
no_click_id_captured | outbox_stuck | action_missing | action_disabled | action_not_counted |
no_upload_lane | platform_unreadable`. Web-side means this is not an offline-upload job: go to
`analytics_diagnose_tracking` (custom domain required, 400 without one) and work `tag-not-deployed`,
`conversion-never-fires`, `conversion-fires-denied`, `duplicate-conversion-paths`. Committing is not
deploying. For `upload_disabled` / `action_missing` / `action_disabled`, continue here.

**3. The two gates.** `marketing_offline_conversions_status` (no params) FIRST: opted in? which
mode - `validate_only: true` means nothing has ever been recorded, so "the platform shows 3" is
expected; enabled mapping for `crm_deal_won` on the Google connection naming an owned action? Then
confirm the action itself with `ppc_conversion_actions_list` (status ENABLED, resource name
matches the mapping) and `ppc_conversion_tracking_status` (silent?, judged on
**`all_conversions`**).

**4. The vocabulary.** Any deal status flagged `is_won`? If not, the pipeline has yielded zero
candidates all along and no connection work changes that. Five-minute fix, and frequently the answer.

**5. Dry run, then read the reasons.** `marketing_offline_conversions_preview({ source:
'crm_deal_won', lookback_days })` - a dry run pinned server-side, writes nothing - gives the
per-reason skip counts and a sample of up to 10 rows for the 15 (for rows you assembled by hand,
`ppc_offline_conversion_upload` with **no `confirm`** is the equivalent truth table). Bucket the
refusals:
- Mostly `no_click_id`: a capture problem, not an upload problem. Cross-check
  `marketing_form_conversion_audit` (trap: **`clicks_before_range: 0` when `click_dated` is 0 means
  NOT MEASURABLE, not zero**) and, for calls, `marketing_call_attribution_list`. Fix the embed,
  consent gate or hostname registration upstream and stop promising all 15.
- Mostly `stale_click` with `dated_by` on the `created_at` fallback: conservative refusals from old
  contact records, not old clicks. Recovering them would need `source_history` to have dated the
  click, which it did not.
- Mostly `no_value`: no deal amounts in the CRM. Either they populate them or ROAS is off the table.
- `conversion_too_old`: past 63 days, gone forever. Move to a daily or weekly cadence.
- Gate reasons: clear per section 8, then preview again.

**6. Confirm and run.** Present eligible count, total value, currency, the conversion action
resource name being written to, the refusal breakdown, AND the mode from step 3. Get an explicit
yes. In validate-only, `marketing_offline_conversions_run({ source: 'crm_deal_won' })` proves the
payloads and records nothing - rows finish `validated`, and that run is what the human reviews
before flipping live in the dashboard (a flip no tool performs). On a LIVE account the same call
records real conversions that reach Smart Bidding and cannot be un-sent: preview first, run ONCE,
read the dispatch tallies back (`outcome: clean` or `partial`), never retry in a loop.
Hand-assembled rows instead: repeat the **identical** `ppc_offline_conversion_upload` call with
`confirm: true`. Report per-row outcomes from `marketing_offline_conversions_queue({ source,
status })`: uploaded, validated, skipped, failed.

**7. Expectations and close-out.** The 6-hour floor plus platform processing means "check tomorrow",
not "refresh now". Once a human has gone live, `marketing_offline_conversions_requeue` re-arms the
`validated` rows (409 until then) and one more confirmed run uploads them. Verify next day with
`ppc_conversion_tracking_status` on that action, judged on `all_conversions`. Record the decision
(action, mapping, mode, cadence) with `memory_create`, and file the cadence and upstream capture
fixes as `pm_tasks_create` items.

**The honest answer this play usually produces:** of 15 deals, some never had a click id and can
never be uploaded, some are past the 63-day horizon and are gone, and the rest are recoverable now.
Give those three numbers separately - and while the account is validate-only, a fourth: validated
but not yet recorded, waiting on the human go-live. "We recovered 9, 4 have no click id because of a consent-gated
embed we are fixing this week, and 2 closed 71 days ago and are outside Google's import window" is a
report worth paying for. "It is fixed" is not.

## 13. The declared lane: ten `marketing_offline_conversions_*` tools

The Lane A pipeline is declared to MCP. These are the tools (verified against the plugin's
`lib/tool-index.json` on 2026-08-29; all `marketing_`-prefixed, so a `marketing-ads` key sees
them). They DISCOVER conversions from the CRM, forms and Shopify and push them to the platform -
the opposite of `ppc_offline_conversion_upload`, where you supply the rows.

Vocabulary, fixed: sources `crm_deal_won | form_lead | shopify_order`; platforms `google_ads |
microsoft_ads | meta_ads`; row statuses `queued | validated | uploaded | failed | skipped`.

| Tool | Args | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `marketing_offline_conversions_status` | none (GET) | Opt-in state, `validate_only` mode, designated actions per connection/source, outbox tallies by status. **Read it FIRST, before any other call here.** |
| `marketing_offline_conversion_actions_list` | `connection_id` | The EXISTING conversion actions the lane could be designated to. Hiveku never creates one. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_opt_in` | `enabled`, `lookback_days` 1-90 (default 30), `note` | Enables (or disables) the lane. Enabling from off ALWAYS lands in validate-only; on an already-live account it preserves live mode. The response `note` states the real mode - relay it verbatim. `validate_only: false` here is a 403. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_validate_only` | `validate_only` (must be `true`) | Puts a LIVE account back into validate-only. The SAFE direction only: anything else is a 403; 409 `not_opted_in` if never enabled; `changed: false` if already there. Does not retract conversions already uploaded. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_designate` | `connection_id`, `source`, `conversion_action`, `conversion_action_name`, `value_mode` (`source_value` or `fixed_value`), `fixed_value`, `max_value`, `currency_code`, `match_mode` (`click` or `enhanced`), `enabled` | Maps a source to an EXISTING action. `enabled: true` arms it; a designation with `enabled: false` exists but does not run. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_remove_mapping` | `connection_id`, `source` | Returns `{ removed, cancelled_rows }`: queued rows are cancelled, not uploaded. Rows already uploaded are NOT retracted. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_preview` | `source`, `lookback_days` | Dry-run discovery: what WOULD be enqueued, with up to 10 sample rows and per-reason skip counts. The dry-run flag is pinned server-side - it writes nothing and sends nothing, ever. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_queue` | `source`, `status`, `limit` 1-100 (default 25) | The outbox, newest first. Read-only. `click_id` and email/phone hashes come back MASKED. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_run` | `source`, `limit` 1-500 (default 500) | Discover AND dispatch: enqueue new rows, then work the outbox. 409 `not_opted_in` / 409 `source_not_designated` when a gate is shut. Returns `outcome` (`clean` or `partial`) and dispatch tallies. |
| `marketing_offline_conversions_requeue` | none | Re-arms `validated` rows so the next run uploads them for real. Only meaningful AFTER a human took the account live - 409 with the reason otherwise. Returns `{ requeued }`. |

### The doctrine, exactly

- **Enabling always lands in validate-only.** Every payload is proven against the ad platform and
  NOTHING is recorded. Rows finish `validated`, which is proof the mapping and the data work, not a
  conversion.
- **The go-live flip is withheld from agents.** `validate_only: false` returns 403 from every tool
  here. An account owner or admin flips it in the dashboard after reviewing a validate-only run.
  Your deliverable is that reviewable run plus a `pm_tasks_create` naming the flip; never "I turned
  it on".
- **Opt-in never un-arms a live account.** Calling `opt_in` on an account a human already took live
  preserves live mode; read the response `note` back to the user verbatim so nobody assumes the
  account is safe when it is not.
- **`validate_only` only ever makes it safer.** It takes the account from live back to validate-only
  and nothing else; conversions already uploaded stay on the ad account and keep influencing bidding.
- **Hiveku never creates a conversion action.** Designation points at one that already exists:
  Google, the ConversionAction resource name; Microsoft, the OfflineConversionGoal NAME (exact);
  Meta, the CAPI event name (`Lead`, `Purchase`) - section 3. If no Upload-source action exists on
  Google, the operator creates one with `ppc_google_conversion_actions` (`type_: 'UPLOAD_CLICKS'`,
  confirmed), then designates; the lane itself never will.
- **`match_mode`.** `click` matches on the stored gclid/gbraid/wbraid/msclkid/fbclid. `enhanced`
  sends hashed email/phone for Google enhanced-conversions-for-leads and is REFUSED for meta_ads -
  that lane sends only the `fbc` click parameter, never PII (`policy_no_pii`, section 3).
- **Windows are enforced at enqueue:** google/microsoft 90 days, meta 7 days; a conversion older
  than 63 days is refused rather than queued. A refusal for age is not an error - it is the lane
  declining an upload that could only fail (section 4).
- **Value.** `source_value` uses the deal or order amount; `fixed_value` a per-lead figure you set.
  A single value above 1,000,000 in the mapping currency is REFUSED, never clamped; `max_value`
  lowers that ceiling per mapping.
- **A live run is a money write.** On a LIVE account `run` records real conversions that reach the
  client's Smart Bidding and cannot be un-sent - `remove_mapping` and `validate_only` do not retract
  them. Preview first, run ONCE, read the dispatch tallies back; `partial` means some rows failed
  permanently or a connection errored - read the counts, do not retry in a loop.
- **Identifiers come back masked** from `queue`: per-visitor tokens and platform match keys are not
  data to copy into a report, a task, or memory.

### The order that works

1. `marketing_offline_conversions_status` - opted in? which mode? what is designated? what sits in
   the outbox?
2. `marketing_offline_conversion_actions_list({ connection_id })` per connection - pick the existing
   action; check the shape per platform (section 3).
3. `marketing_offline_conversions_opt_in({ enabled: true, lookback_days })` - after the operator's
   explicit yes to sharing conversion data with the platform. Relay the `note`.
4. `marketing_offline_conversions_designate({ ..., enabled: true })` per (connection, source), each
   confirmed. Confirm the `is_won` vocabulary exists first (section 6) or `crm_deal_won` yields zero.
5. `marketing_offline_conversions_preview({ source, lookback_days })` - relay the skip reasons per
   section 8.
6. `marketing_offline_conversions_run({ source })` - in validate-only this proves the payloads and
   records nothing. Read `queue({ source, status: 'validated' })` and `status` back.
7. Hand the human the reviewable result and the go-live task. When they flip it live:
   `marketing_offline_conversions_requeue`, then one more confirmed run, then read the tallies.
8. Cadence: daily (Meta's 7-day window) as a workflow job, dry-run first (`/hiveku:automate`).

### Hard stops, response contracts

- *"Skip validate-only, just take it live so the numbers move."* Refuse: no tool can, and a 403 is
  the answer even if you tried. Offer the validate-only run to review and the dashboard flip for the
  owner.
- *"The platform shows zero - run it until something uploads."* Refuse the loop. One run, tallies,
  reasons. A `partial` outcome is read, not retried.
- *"Match Meta on email so more of them stick."* Refuse: `enhanced` is a `policy_no_pii` refusal on
  meta_ads by design; Meta gets `fbc` only.
- *"Remove the mapping to undo last week's upload."* It cancels queued rows only; uploaded
  conversions stay. Say so before the call.
