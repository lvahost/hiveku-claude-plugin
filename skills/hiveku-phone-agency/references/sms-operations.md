# SMS Operations: Sending, Reading, Bulk, Templates, Compliance

Load this before you send a text, before you build any inbound-text automation, before you
answer a compliance question, and before you tell a user that anything about SMS is impossible.
This file replaces the old communications `sms.md`; registration (10DLC and toll-free) moved to
`tendlc-and-toll-free.md` in this skill - go there for anything about brands, campaigns,
verification, or "why do carriers filter us".

Written for the surface's final state. The availability rule applies: a tool name that does not
resolve has not shipped on this server yet - never conclude the capability does not exist, and
never invent a name to fill a gap. Anything not yet reachable is still doable in the dashboard
SMS inbox and composer.

## Availability

| `voice_sms_thread_reply` | LIVE | Reply inside an existing conversation |
| `voice_sms_threads_list` | LIVE | The SMS inbox |

| `voice_sms_scheduled_list` | INCOMING | Lists pending scheduled sends |
| `voice_sms_scheduled_cancel` | INCOMING | Cancels one scheduled send (hard delete) |

Profile note: `voice_*` and `workflow_*` names resolve under this skill's key; the `crm_*`
(DNC), `helpdesk_*` and `survey_*` tools referenced below resolve only under a broader profile
such as `full`. An older copy of this document said no tool lists or cancels a scheduled send
and that bulk was dashboard-only; both claims are retired - the tools above cover them.

## Part 1: The rails, and which one to pick

There are four ways a text leaves this platform. Pick by job, not by habit:

| The job | Rail |
|---|---|
| One specific message to one person, now | `voice_sms_send_to_contact` (CRM contact) or `voice_sms_send` (raw E.164) |
| Reply in an existing conversation | `voice_sms_thread_reply` |
| The same message to a list (up to 200) | `voice_sms_bulk_send` (INCOMING) - preview and count-approve first |
| Text automatically on an event (form, missed call, schedule, inbound text) | The workflow `sms` node |
| A survey or review ask by text | `survey_send({ channel: 'sms' })`, or the `surveySend` / `reviewRequest` / `reviewFunnelSend` nodes - these mint tokens, apply suppression, and honor quiet hours; never hand-roll them with an `sms` node |

**Two send rails run underneath, and they enforce different things.** The automation rail
(`dispatchAccountSms`: the `sms` node, the dashboard composer, survey/review senders, the
missed-call autoresponder, invoice texter, helpdesk agent) enforces the eight gates below,
including the `sms_not_enabled` registration check and the automation volume caps. The direct
tools call the send funnel directly: they enforce plan gating (402 `voice_not_enabled`), DID
ownership, the opt-out table, and the reputation governor - but (for the SINGLE sends; the bulk tool is the exception below) **NO 10DLC registration check
and NO automation caps**. Unregistered US A2P traffic from a local DID is accepted by the
direct tools and then filtered by carriers while your stored row still reads `sent`.

### The automation rail's gates, in order

The `sms` node surfaces the first tripped gate's reason verbatim in `step_states`; knowing the
order turns "the SMS node failed" into a fix. The first gate that trips returns and nothing is
sent.

1. **Recipient normalizes to E.164** (10 digits gets `+1`; 11 starting with 1 gets `+`; a
   leading `+` keeps its digits) - else `invalid_to`.
2. **Body non-empty after trim** - else `empty_body`. This is what an unresolved `{{template}}`
   produces: an unresolved placeholder collapses to an empty string, so a populated-looking
   config that errors "empty body" or "no recipient" means a template resolved to nothing
   (`workflow_run_get` shows the node's resolved `input`).
3. **Account operational** - else `account_suspended`.
4. **The account can send SMS at all** - else `sms_not_enabled`. The rule is an OR: a VERIFIED
   brand with an ACTIVE, provisioned campaign, OR at least one verified toll-free DID. When
   this trips, `voice_sms_registration_get` is the verdict tool (tendlc file).
5. **Not opted out** - else `opted_out` (Part 6).
6. **Automation volume caps** (below).
7. **A sending number resolves** - else `no_sending_number`; an explicit unverified toll-free
   `from` is refused loudly as `toll_free_unverified`.
8. **Carrier send** - failure returns `send_failed` with the carrier's message.

### The caps, and the governor

**Automation caps** (workflow nodes, agents, crons - any send with no user attached): **100
per hour per account, 400 per day per account, 6 per hour to a single recipient.** Failed
sends count (attempts are read from message rows), and the counting query fails open so a DB
blip never silences legitimate automation. A human in the dashboard composer neither consumes
nor is blocked by this budget. **Do not split a blast across hours, workflows or the direct
tools to dodge the caps** - carrier filtering does not care which rail the volume rode in on,
and a filtered campaign is far more expensive than a capped one. Per-account overrides exist
in account settings and are not writable from this surface.

**The reputation governor** sits inside the shared send funnel and applies to EVERY rail: a
kill switch (`sms_sending_paused`), a carrier-prohibited-content screen, a per-plan UTC DAILY
cap (100 on free and trial, 500 hosting, 5000 premium, 10000 business, 50000 enterprise, 2000
on any unrecognized plan unless `daily_sms_cap_override` raises it), and a per-minute velocity
cap. A governor refusal surfaces as a 502 `send_failed` carrying a human-readable reason: it
is a POLICY refusal and an immediate retry will not help. An hourly abuse monitor can also
auto-pause an account on opt-out or carrier-failure spikes - a sudden universal
`sms_sending_paused` is that, not an outage.

**There are NO quiet hours on the direct tools or the `sms` node.** A `scheduledTrigger` at
03:00 texts at 03:00, and `scheduled_for` is an absolute UTC instant that never reads the
contact's timezone. Quiet hours (09:00-20:00 local, defaulting to US Central) live one layer
up, in the survey/review/referral senders only - which report a throttled or quiet-hours
contact as **skipped, not failed**, and reschedule rather than send. For marketing-shaped
automation, put the time discipline in the trigger: pin the cron to a business hour in the
ACCOUNT's timezone, or gate an event-driven text through a `conditional` on the current hour.
`survey_send` called at 22:00 reschedules - report "scheduled", never "sent".

### Workflow-node facts that keep biting

Kept from the old manual because they still decide outcomes; the automation skill's node rail
covers the rest.

- The node's keys are `to`, `body`, `from` (optional; see sender resolution in Part 2). On a
  form workflow, `{{trigger.form_fields}}` renders every non-empty field as `Label: value`
  lines. On success the node adds `sms.message_id` / `sms.thread_id` - never report a text as
  sent without a `message_id`.
- Prefer `{{trigger.body}}` / `{{<nodeId>.body}}` forms. `{{data.from}}` does NOT resolve
  downstream of `smsReceivedTrigger` (the `data` alias points at a `payload` key the SMS
  trigger does not have).
- **Retries can double-send.** Node defaults are 30s timeout, `maxAttempts: 2`; the rail has
  no idempotency key across attempts, so a carrier-delivered-but-timed-out response retries
  into a second text. If a duplicate is unacceptable, set
  `data.executionConfig = { retryPolicy: { maxAttempts: 1 } }`. Do not set `onError:
  'continue'` on a workflow whose whole purpose is the text.
- Inbound triggering: the graph node IS the subscription - do not call
  `workflow_trigger_create` for SMS (`workflow_event_trigger_types_list` is the discovery
  tool). `keyword_filter` is a case-insensitive SUBSTRING match (`stop` matches "nonstop";
  pick distinctive words like `QUOTE`, `BOOK`); `number_filter` compares last ten digits and
  FAILS CLOSED when the inbound DID cannot be resolved; pass both as strings. Inbound
  trigger fan-out is throttled at 30/account/min and 6/sender/min - "the ticket exists but no
  workflow ran" is that throttle, not a broken workflow. A paused workflow still matches and
  records a replayable stopped run; a disabled one does not.

---

## Part 2: Sending

All direct sends are REAL texts to a real handset within seconds, billed per segment, with no
draft state, no recall, and **no idempotency key anywhere: two identical calls are two
texts.** Send only wording a human has approved. After ANY ambiguous outcome (timeout, 502,
dropped connection), read the thread with `voice_sms_thread_messages_list` BEFORE any second
call - "run it again to make sure" is a second text on the customer's phone.

### `voice_sms_send({ tenant_e164, peer_e164, body, media_urls? })`

Starts or reuses the thread between your DID and the peer, writes the outbound row, and
dispatches. Since the 2026-08-29 program it also **mirrors to the CRM timeline and fires the
outbound webhook at carrier accept** (the fan-out event is named `sms.delivered` but fires at
carrier ACCEPT - a naming lie to plan around). Traps:

- **Returns `{ thread }` ONLY** - no message id, no carrier id - so the response cannot
  confirm the outcome; read it back on the returned thread id.
- Refusals: 402 `voice_not_enabled`; 403 `not_your_number` (tenant_e164 not an active DID
  here); 409 `opted_out` (Part 6); 422 `invalid_body`.
- **A 200 means the carrier gateway ACCEPTED the message**, not that it arrived: the row is
  stamped `sent` and only the later delivery receipt flips it.
- **A 502 `send_failed` is NOT a no-op** - the thread and a `failed` message row are already
  committed; blind retries leave a trail of failed rows and can double-send if the first
  attempt actually reached the carrier.
- No registration check (Part 1); only toll-free senders are gated, and an unverified
  toll-free DID dies as a 502 inside the funnel.
- An API key has no builder profile, so the send shows no sender and writes NO voice audit
  row - true of every tool in this file.

### `voice_sms_send_to_contact({ contact_id, body, ... })`

Sends to a CRM contact - **the recipient comes from `crm_contacts.phone` ONLY, never from
your input.** Extra refusals and traps, all from its registered description:

- 404 `contact_not_found`; 409 `no_contact_phone`; and **403 `opted_out` - a 403 HERE where
  the thread routes return 409 for the same condition, so key on the error string, not the
  status.** Consent is checked ONLY against the opt-out table, never `lifecycle_stage` or a
  CRM column (the CRM DNC route writes into the same opt-out table, which is why one check
  suffices).
- **`from_e164` is how a rep's direct line sends under a key.** The session send path
  resolves the signed-in rep's assigned caller-ID number; an API key has no person behind it,
  so the Olympus path uses the account pick (purpose `main`, then oldest active DID, local
  plus VERIFIED toll-free only, fails closed). To text as Rebecca's line, pass her DID as
  `from_e164` explicitly. It is ownership-checked but NOT toll-free-verification-checked - an
  unverified toll-free `from_e164` clears the 403 and dies as a 502. Omit it when in doubt.
- Phone parsing: `214-555-1212 x5` parses to 11 digits not starting with 1 and refuses as
  `no_contact_phone`; a stored value already starting `+` passes through with NO length
  check.
- Template trap: merge vars render ONLY when your body exactly equals the stored template
  body (trimmed); any edited body still holding `{contact_first_name}` arrives as literal
  braces, and `{sender_first_name}` renders EMPTY under an API key.
- **Raw-body-on-timeline trap: the `crm_activities` mirror and the webhook payload store your
  RAW input body, not the rendered text** - a merge-var send shows the un-rendered template on
  the CRM timeline while the customer got the rendered version. Reconcile against the message
  row, not the activity, when wording matters.
- Success returns `{ message_id, thread_id, from_e164, to_e164 }` - no carrier id, no
  delivery status. The same accepted-not-delivered and 502-wrote-the-row rules apply.
- The scheduled branch is in Part 4.

### `voice_sms_thread_reply({ thread_id, body, media_urls? })`

Appends to an existing conversation. **Both the recipient and the sending DID are read off the
STORED thread - `tenant_e164` is frozen at thread creation, and that is CORRECT**: the
customer has that number saved and replies to it; repointing an existing conversation at a
new rep line would strand their replies. Only NEW conversations pick up a different sender.
Say this out loud when someone ships a caller-ID change and "old threads still use the old
number" - it is the first thing that looks broken and is not.

- Returns `{ message }` with an OPTIMISTIC `delivery_status` of `'sent'` (accepted, never
  delivered).
- 409 `opted_out` is re-checked on EVERY reply, even deep inside an open conversation - a
  STOP still applies in the thread it was sent in.
- Unlike `voice_sms_send`, it does NOT re-verify the DID is still yours or active: a reply on
  a released number is attempted and fails at the carrier instead of being refused here.
- `last_message_at` bumps BEFORE dispatch, so even a failed send jumps the thread to the top
  of the inbox.
- It mirrors to the CRM timeline and fires the webhook (closed 2026-08-27; older copies of
  this document said a thread reply was invisible on the contact timeline - retired).

### A contact owns N threads - one per sending DID

The thread key is (account, your DID, their number). `voice_sms_send_to_contact` picks the
main/rep DID while the missed-call text-back sends from the DID that was CALLED, so the same
person routinely holds two or more threads. **Any "first thread" pick hides half the
conversation.** When reading a contact's SMS history, resolve ALL their threads (by
`contact_id` and by phone), or use `crm_list_activities({ type: 'sms', contact_id })` /
`crm_contact_touch_history` for the merged view (the read-side `type` filter accepts `sms`
even though the description does not list it; `crm_create_activity` REJECTS `type: 'sms'` -
the write side enforces the whitelist).

### MMS

`media_urls` promotes a send to MMS on all three tools: max 10 public HTTPS URLs, fetched by
the carrier gateway itself - a private, signed or expiring URL fails at the carrier, not
here. Body may be empty only when media is present (a caption-less MMS ships a single-space
placeholder and stores an empty body). **The 600KB pass-through cap:** static images
(jpeg/png/webp) are transcoded and can be up to ~5MB, but animated GIF, video, audio and PDF
pass through UNRESIZED - carriers cap MMS around 600KB and STRIP oversize media while STILL
DELIVERING the text. The sender sees `delivered`; the recipient sees a blank message. That is
why photos work and big GIFs arrive empty. Diagnostic for "MMS delivered but blank": check
the media byte size (`curl -sIL` the URL) before suspecting auth or format.

---

## Part 3: Reading

### `voice_sms_threads_list` - the inbox

Paged, newest first by `last_message_at`; each thread carries `tenant_e164`, `peer_e164`,
`unread_count`, `archived`, `contact_id`, and a `preview`. The one tool in the SMS group that
changes nothing. Traps from its description: **a 402 `voice_not_enabled` is a plan refusal,
NOT an empty inbox**; `limit` clamps to 1-100 and a non-numeric limit is not coerced; a bad
or foreign `cursor` is SILENTLY IGNORED and replays page one, so a pager feeding a stale
cursor loops forever; `unread_only` / `archived` compare against the literal strings
`'true'` / `'false'` and any other value applies NO filter; the `q` search scans at most 2000
message rows (`search_truncated: true` = partial, not exhaustive) and returns an EMPTY list
when nothing matches rather than falling back to unfiltered; `preview.body` is cut to 200
characters. Every row is customer PII.

### `voice_sms_thread_messages_list` - the transcript, now read-only by default

One thread's messages, newest first, each carrying `direction`, `body`, `media_urls`,
`delivery_status`, `error_message`, `sent_at` and the carrier message id.

**The default flipped in the 2026-08-29 program: this tool is READ-ONLY BY DEFAULT.** The
thread's unread badge clears ONLY on an explicit `mark_read: 'true'` (the exact string). Pass
it only when you are surfacing the conversation to a human who is actually reading it - never
on a poll, a background sync, or a pagination fetch. An older copy of this document (and an
older registered description) said the reset was the default and taught `mark_read: 'false'`
as the escape hatch; if the description you fetch still says that, it predates the flip -
trust the explicit-opt-in behavior and pass `'true'` only deliberately.

Other traps: the cursor must be a message id from inside THIS thread and an unresolvable one
is a HARD 400 `invalid_cursor` (deliberately unlike the threads list); `limit` clamps 1-200; a
foreign thread id is a plain 404, indistinguishable from a deleted thread; the output is the
full conversation plus MMS URLs - customer PII.

### `delivery_status` lies three ways

Vocabulary: `queued | scheduled | sent | delivered | failed` (every carrier failure collapses
to `failed`; `undelivered` is never written), and null means never reconciled - unknown, NOT
failed. The three lies:

1. **`sent` != `delivered`.** `sent` means the gateway accepted it; a carrier-filtered
   message sits at `sent` forever. Only `delivered` is delivery.
2. **The CRM activity mirror carries NO delivery status at all.** Absent means "unknown",
   never "sent" - do not report delivery from the contact timeline.
3. **`error_message` is never cleared** (the receipt handler coalesces it), so a delivered
   row can still carry old carrier error text. Only read `error_message` when
   `delivery_status` is `failed`.

---

## Part 4: Bulk and scheduled

### `voice_sms_bulk_send` (INCOMING) - up to 200 real texts in one call

The blast tool, ask-gated for obvious reasons. Non-negotiable discipline:

- **Audience preview and count approval FIRST.** Resolve the recipient list, show the human
  the exact count and a sample, get an explicit yes on THAT count, then send. Never derive an
  audience and fire in one motion.
- Hard cap 200 recipients per call. Per-recipient opt-out rows are SKIPPED per row, not
  refused for the batch; template bodies render per recipient.
- **A governor refusal mid-batch lands the remainder in `failed[]` - NEVER blindly re-run
  the call.** The messages before the refusal were REAL sends; re-running the batch
  double-texts everyone who succeeded. Read the per-row results, and re-send only the failed
  remainder, deliberately, after understanding why the governor tripped (daily cap and
  velocity are policy, not transient).
- `scheduled_for` defers the whole batch: an absolute UTC instant more than 30 seconds ahead
  (nearer or past sends NOW). **No quiet hours** - a batch scheduled at 03:00 UTC lands at
  03:00 UTC.
- Unlike the single sends, bulk DOES enforce 10DLC readiness up front: `409 sms_not_enabled`
  (no VERIFIED brand + ACTIVE campaign, and no verified toll-free sender) refuses the whole
  batch BEFORE any row is written. Past that gate the governor's plan-daily cap still counts
  every message in the batch.

### Scheduled sends: `scheduled_for` on `voice_sms_send_to_contact` and bulk

The scheduled branch writes a `delivery_status: 'scheduled'` row and returns without calling
the carrier; a cron dispatches later (50 rows per tick platform-wide, opt-out re-checked at
dispatch, the sending DID read off the thread WITHOUT re-verifying it is still active). Known
gaps, from the registered description: the scheduled path writes NO `crm_activities` row,
fires NO webhook, and never bumps template usage - a scheduled send is invisible on the
contact timeline until it dispatches. And it can land at 3am local: absolute UTC, no timezone
awareness. Say both to the user before scheduling.

### `voice_sms_scheduled_list` (INCOMING)

Lists pending scheduled messages (filterable by thread, from, to; cursored). **The definition
of "scheduled" is BOTH conditions: `delivery_status === 'scheduled'` AND a `scheduled_for`
value - because `scheduled_for` is never cleared on dispatch.** A row with `scheduled_for`
set and status `sent` already went out; counting on `scheduled_for` alone marks every
formerly-scheduled message as pending forever.

### `voice_sms_scheduled_cancel` (INCOMING)

Cancels ONE scheduled send by message id. **It is a HARD DELETE of the row** - no tombstone,
no history - and it refuses anything due within 5 seconds, because the dispatch cron may
already have selected the row; the delete re-asserts both scheduled conditions so a message
that slipped into dispatch cannot be "cancelled" after it went. A 409 `not_scheduled` means
the row fails the two-condition test - it already sent, or was never scheduled - so read the
row before telling the user it was stopped. Cancel-then-reschedule is the edit path; there is
no in-place update of a scheduled message.

The workflow-side substitutes remain valid and more inspectable: a `delay` node or a
`scheduledTrigger`, which you can list and disable.

---

## Part 5: Templates

Four tools over reusable snippets that reach nobody until a send route renders them. The
traps, each from the registered descriptions:

- **`voice_sms_templates_list`** - ORDERING TRAP: sort is `last_used_at DESC` and Postgres
  puts NULLS FIRST on DESC, so every NEVER-USED template leads the list ahead of the one sent
  an hour ago; do not read position 0 as "most used". COUNTER TRAP: `usage_count` /
  `last_used_at` move only when an IMMEDIATE send carried `template_id` and cleared the
  carrier - scheduled sends never bump, failed sends never bump, and an edited-body send
  still bumps (keyed on id alone). The counters both undercount and mislead. No filters, no
  pagination: hundreds of templates return in one payload. Merge vars substitute at send time
  only, matched lowercase-with-underscores only (`{Contact_First_Name}` and `{firstName}`
  never match), and an unknown placeholder is left INTACT - which is how literal braces reach
  a handset.
- **`voice_sms_template_create`** - SHORTCUT TRAP: the shortcut regex ends in `*`, so an
  EMPTY STRING passes validation and is stored as a real value; the unique index is
  (account, shortcut), so the SECOND template created with `''` is a 409 `shortcut_taken`.
  OMIT the field rather than passing `''` (omitted stores NULL, which never collides). No
  dedupe on name or body: calling twice creates two identical templates, and there is no
  merge tool. Nothing validates placeholders - a typo like `{firstName}` is accepted silently
  and later texts literal braces to a customer.
- **`voice_sms_template_update`** - SILENT NO-OP: an empty object answers 200 having changed
  nothing but `updated_at`, and unknown keys are stripped without error. Confirm an edit by
  reading the returned row, never the status code. Pass `category`/`shortcut` as null to
  CLEAR them; `''` does not clear a shortcut, it stores a colliding empty value. It returns
  the FULL row where list/create return an eight-field projection - do not assume the shapes
  match. Editing a body cannot reach anything already sent OR already scheduled: every
  message row stored its own rendered text at creation.
- **`voice_sms_template_delete`** - IRREVERSIBLE: no soft delete, no history, no undo. **NO
  DEPENDENCY GUARD**: nothing checks references, `template_id` on messages has no FK, so
  historical rows point at a dead id and usage reports joining on it silently go blank; a
  `/shortcut` a human types every day just stops expanding, with no warning to them. Read the
  body with the list tool FIRST. It does not unsend anything - sent and scheduled messages
  keep their stored text. A 200 proves the row is absent, not that this call removed it.

---

## Part 6: Inbound, STOP, and the two suppression layers

### The inbound pipeline, end to end

1. The carrier delivers the inbound webhook to the voice server.
2. The ingester persists thread + message, matches a CRM contact by phone, and emits a
   pointer event (never the body) for realtime UIs.
3. **Compliance keywords are detected and acted on HERE**, before the builder is involved.
4. If and only if the message is not a bare compliance keyword, the ingester notifies the
   builder.
5. The builder route does three independent things: opens or threads a helpdesk ticket, fires
   inbound-SMS workflow triggers, and sends the bell plus mobile push.

Step 4 is the gate: anything suppressed at step 3 never reaches workflows, helpdesk or
notifications - though the message row IS persisted and visible in
`voice_sms_thread_messages_list`. The insert is idempotent on the carrier's message id, so a
re-delivery never re-fires the trigger.

### The keyword sets, matched on the FIRST WORD, case-insensitive

- **Opt-out:** `stop`, `unsubscribe`, `cancel`, `end`, `quit`, `stopall`
- **Opt-in:** `start`, `unstop`, `yes`

A first-word opt-out writes the opt-out row; a first-word opt-in DELETES it. Every outbound
path consults that table and refuses an opted-out peer (the automation rail as `opted_out`;
the thread tools as 409; `voice_sms_send_to_contact` as 403). The carrier layer independently
blocks and auto-confirms - double protection, verified live.

### The suppression rule, and what follows

The builder is NOT notified when a compliance keyword was detected AND the keyword is not
`yes` AND **the entire message body is exactly ONE word.** No bell, no push, no ticket, and
**no `smsReceivedTrigger` fire.**

- **A workflow triggered on "STOP" will never fire. It is not partially working; it is
  dead.** The platform already registered the opt-out, already refuses future sends, and the
  carrier already confirmed. Offer the multi-word variant ("STOP texting me" is a human
  talking and DOES notify) if the user wants to catch angry unsubscribes phrased as sentences.
- **`cancel`, `end` and `quit` are OPT-OUTS.** A customer replying a bare "CANCEL" to an
  appointment reminder is opted out of ALL future SMS, and your cancellation workflow never
  sees it. A flow that needs a text-back cancellation must instruct a word not on the list,
  in the outbound message itself.
- **`yes` is deliberately carved out** - it is the word the chat-to-SMS handoff asks for. A
  bare "YES" notifies, fires triggers, and registers as an opt-in.
- You cannot test suppression with `test_mode` - it happens upstream of the workflow engine.
  A real STOP from a real handset writes a real opt-out row; do it deliberately or not at
  all (`start` reverses it).
- **Expect prior-owner baggage on a freshly purchased DID.** STOPs arriving on a number that
  has never sent anything are aimed at its PREVIOUS owner - recycled DIDs arrive with the
  prior owner's threads on strangers' phones. The opt-outs they write are correct; do not
  treat them as an incident. (Bare-keyword inbound no longer pushes to the team for exactly
  this reason.)

### `voice_sms_opt_out_add` - the manual entry, and its semantics

For honouring a stop request made by phone, email or in person, from a number that may not be
a contact. Adds one E.164 to the account's do-not-text list (source `manual`); every outbound
path then refuses it. From its registered description: **SILENT NO-OP - if a row already
exists, NOTHING is written and the answer is still 200 with `already_present: true`; your
note is discarded and the stored reason and date are untouched.** It can never correct or
re-date an existing opt-out. **NOT PERMANENT**: a later inbound whose first word is `start`,
`unstop` or `yes` deletes the row - including an unrelated "yes please". NARROW: SMS only,
this account only, the literal e164 string only - it touches no email suppression, no
sequence suppression, no CRM lifecycle. Two concurrent adds of the same number can collide as
a 500 rather than a clean `already_present`. For a known CRM contact prefer `crm_set_dnc`,
which does all channels in one transaction.

### Re-subscribe: the removal tool is deliberately absent

**There is no tool that removes an opt-out row by number, and that absence is a compliance
feature, not a gap - do not work around it.** Re-subscription is the customer's OWN texted
START (or the dashboard, where a human owns the decision). Deleting an opt-out to force a
send is a TCPA decision no agent makes. The one tooled path: for a KNOWN CRM contact under a
full-profile key, `crm_remove_dnc({ contact_id, reason })` soft-removes suppression WITH an
audit note - use it sparingly, it does not reset `lifecycle_stage` or `lead_status`, and
undoing a customer's own STOP without their re-consent is a compliance problem in the other
direction. Most requests to undo a DNC are mistakes.

### The two layers, and the phone-format trap

A texted STOP writes a NUMBER-scoped opt-out without touching the CRM contact; `crm_set_dnc`
writes CRM suppression (and the voice opt-out) for a CONTACT. Audit both:
`crm_get_dnc_status({ contact_id })` for the contact, remembering that a bare STOP from a
number the CRM never matched leaves no CRM trace at all.

**The phone-format trap - verify before you report anyone as suppressed.** The send-time
check is an exact string lookup on the E.164-normalized number, but `crm_set_dnc` writes
`contact.phone` AS STORED (trimmed, not normalized), and contacts updated through the update
path keep whatever format was pasted in. So `crm_set_dnc` on a contact stored as
`(555) 123-4567` writes an opt-out row keyed on a string the send path will never look up -
**and `crm_get_dnc_status` reads with the same unnormalized key, so it reports
`sms_suppressed: true` for a row that blocks nothing.** Practical rule: before relying on
`crm_set_dnc` for SMS, read the contact and confirm `phone` is `+1XXXXXXXXXX`; fix it with
`crm_update_contact` first if not. A live mismatch is a compliance incident, not a curiosity.

There is no DNC workflow node; the rail's own `opted_out` refusal is the in-workflow gate.

## Part 7: The helpdesk projection

Inbound texts are also projected into helpdesk as tickets (`channel: 'sms'`, subject "SMS
from <name or number>", `source_meta` carrying `sms_thread_id`, `sms_did` and `peer_e164` -
your reply address). Conditions: gated on the account actually using helpdesk
(`helpdesk_ticket_list({ channel: 'sms' })` empty on an account you know receives texts means
the helpdesk flag, not your query - read the thread directly); best-effort (a failed ingest
logs rather than raises); new messages thread into an `open`/`pending` ticket while a
resolved/closed one gets a fresh ticket; auto-acknowledge is deliberately skipped for SMS.

Read with `helpdesk_ticket_list` -> `helpdesk_ticket_get` / `helpdesk_ticket_messages`
(inbound rows carry the voice message and thread ids for correlation), or
`helpdesk_ticket_list_for_contact` for one person. `helpdesk_macros_list` +
`helpdesk_macros_render` for reply text so you never ship raw placeholders.

### `helpdesk_ticket_send_reply` DELIVERS NOTHING for SMS tickets

The worst verified silent failure on this surface. The reply tool writes the outbound message
row, stamps first-response, returns success - and has **no delivery branch for
`channel === 'sms'`**. The ticket looks handled; the customer is still waiting; nothing
errors. The `helpdeskSendReply` workflow node has the same hole.

**To actually text the customer back:** `voice_sms_thread_reply` on the ticket's
`source_meta.sms_thread_id`, THEN log the reply on the ticket (the thread reply writes no
ticket row). In an automation, the idiomatic pair is the `sms` node (delivers) plus the
helpdesk reply (records). Do only the second half and you have written a note to yourself.

The one exception: a CHAT ticket linked to an SMS thread with `sms_link_confirmed: true` (the
customer replied YES) does mirror replies out as texts - to the thread's peer number, never
`contact.phone`, and it consumes the automation volume budget. And `helpdesk_ticket_create`
accepts `channel: 'sms'` but creates a label with no underlying thread - only do it
deliberately. An email ticket can never answer via SMS; the channels are structurally
separate.

## Part 8: Diagnosis quick reference

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Workflow never fires on "STOP" | Bare compliance keywords never reach the builder. Working as designed |
| Customer texted "CANCEL", nothing happened, now they get no texts | `cancel` is an opt-out keyword. They are suppressed |
| Bare "YES" fires but bare "START" does not | `yes` is carved out of suppression; `start` is not |
| Keyword filter matches too much | Substring match. `stop` matches "nonstop" |
| Workflow scoped to one number never fires | `number_filter` fails closed when the inbound DID cannot be resolved |
| Trigger ignores a filter entirely | The filter was saved as a non-string type and read as absent |
| Nothing fires and there is no run at all | Workflow disabled, or the graph has no edges (`workflow_validate`) |
| Ticket exists but no workflow ran | Inbound trigger fan-out throttled (30/account/min, 6/sender/min). Ticket and bell are ungated |
| No ticket for an inbound text | Helpdesk not enabled, or best-effort ingest failed. Read the thread directly (Part 3) |
| Reply recorded but customer got nothing | `helpdesk_ticket_send_reply` does not deliver for SMS. Part 7 |
| Node errors "no recipient"/"empty body" and config looks fine | A template resolved to empty. Read `input` in `step_states` |
| Sends stop partway through a batch | Automation caps (100/hr, 400/day, 6/hr per recipient), or the governor's plan daily cap |
| Bulk call answered with a populated `failed[]` tail | Governor tripped mid-batch. The head SENT - re-send only the tail, never the batch |
| One customer stops receiving, others fine | Per-recipient cap, or an opt-out row for that number |
| Every automation send returns `sms_not_enabled` | `voice_sms_registration_get`: read `blocking_reason` (tendlc file) |
| Direct send 502 with a policy-sounding reason | The reputation governor. Retrying will not help |
| ALL sends suddenly 502 `sms_sending_paused` | The abuse monitor auto-paused the account (opt-out or failure spike). A human unpauses in the dashboard |
| Direct send 200 but the customer got nothing | `sent` = accepted. Carriers filter unregistered or unpropagated traffic silently. Read the row, then the tendlc file |
| `delivery_status` is null | Never reconciled - unknown, NOT failed |
| A delivered row carries an old error message | `error_message` is never cleared. Only read it on `failed` |
| Explicit `from` rejected or 502s as unverified toll-free | That DID has not passed toll-free verification |
| Customer got the same text twice | A timeout retry (`maxAttempts: 1` prevents), an operator re-run, or a blindly re-run bulk batch. Read the thread before ANY retry |
| Text arrived at 3am | No quiet hours anywhere on this surface; `scheduled_for` is absolute UTC |
| Review or survey reports skipped | Throttle or quiet hours. Skipped is not failed |
| `sms_suppressed: true` but texts still land | Opt-out row keyed on a non-E.164 phone. Compliance incident (Part 6) |
| A scheduled send never showed on the timeline | The scheduled branch writes no activity row until dispatch. Part 4 |
| Scheduled list shows a message that already sent | Someone filtered on `scheduled_for` alone. Both conditions define scheduled |
| "Cancelled" a scheduled send but it arrived | It was inside the 5-second floor or already dispatched. The 409 was telling you |
| Unread badge cleared without a human opening the thread | Something passed `mark_read: 'true'` on a poll. The default no longer clears it |
| MMS "delivered" but recipient sees a blank | Media over the ~600KB pass-through cap was stripped in transit. Check byte size first |
| Outbound works, inbound never arrives | Deaf messaging profile (no inbound webhook) on a campaign approved before 2026-08-05; the platform self-heals on next touch - count inbound rows to confirm |
| STOPs arriving on a brand-new number that never sent | Prior-owner baggage on a recycled DID. Not an incident |
| The rep's texts go out as the main company number | New threads use the rep's line only when resolvable; existing threads are frozen to their DID (correct); under a key, pass `from_e164` |

### The order to work a "text never sent" report

1. Direct-tool send: `voice_sms_thread_messages_list` on the thread - `delivery_status` and
   `error_message` (on failed) carry the answer.
2. Workflow: `workflow_runs_recent({ status: 'failed' })` - account-wide, so you need not
   know which workflow tripped.
3. `workflow_run_get` and read the `sms` node's `error` in `step_states` - the rail's reason
   verbatim, mapped against Part 1's gate list.
4. `workflow_run_logs` for template misses and retry attempts.
5. A node skipped as `already_sent` means the send-once guard fired: this run was a replay.
6. A node absent from `step_states` was never reached: `workflow_validate`.
7. Everything green and still nothing on the handset: registration or propagation - the
   tendlc file's diagnosis table takes over.
