# Content Strategy - senior operator manual

## What this covers / when to load this

The manual behind Play 3 of the SEO skill: deciding what content to write, refresh, merge, or
kill, and proving the decision paid. SKILL.md gives the arc and the tool list; this file gives
the mechanics the tools hide, the numbers that trigger action, the exact call order per play,
and the failure modes that make a confident answer wrong. Load it for content audits, the
refresh program, cannibalization, SERP features and snippets, E-E-A-T, and shipping any of it
through the SEO implement rail. Not for keyword discovery, crawl and indexation, GSC or Bing
analytics, links, or report assembly (references/keyword-research.md, technical-seo.md,
rankings-and-search-console.md, link-building-and-competitors.md, reporting-and-delivery.md).
Assumes `account_context_get({ domain: 'seo' })` has run and you hold a `project_id` from
`seo_list_projects` (or `hiveku-data/seo/projects.json`).

## 0. How this data is actually produced

Every content tool here reads a table a cron wrote. None compute anything live. Knowing the
pipeline separates "the site has no decay" from "the sweep has never run for this account".

| Tool | Written by |
|---|---|
| `seo_content_decay` | seo-analysis-sweep cron, Sundays 05:35 UTC |
| `seo_cannibalization` | same sweep |
| `seo_eeat_scores` | same sweep, 28-day per-page cadence |
| `seo_featured_snippets` | AEO audit runs only (SKILL.md Play 7) |
| `seo_serp_features` | AEO audit runs only, append-only history |
| `seo_serp_get` | DataForSEO, live and metered, on your call |
| `seo_content_gaps` | **nothing writes its table** |

- **Windows.** Decay and cannibalization compare two 28-day windows anchored at the most recently
  archived GSC day, not today (GSC lags 2 to 3 days): current = maxDate-27d..maxDate, prior =
  maxDate-55d..maxDate-28d. Under 42 days of archive the account is skipped entirely.
- **Decay floors.** Prior window needs 100+ impressions and 5+ clicks. Flagged when clicks fell
  25 percent or more (`decay_type: 'traffic'`), or impression-weighted average position worsened
  by 3.0+ while clicks fell 10 percent or more (`'position'`), or both. `decay_severity`: severe
  at 60 percent decline, moderate at 40, else mild. Top 100 pages per account per run.
- **Cannibalization floors** (table `seo_keyword_cannibalization`). Per (domain, query) in the
  current window a competing page needs 50+ impressions; a finding needs 2+ such pages and 200+
  combined impressions. `severity: 'high'` when 3+ pages compete or the runner-up takes 40 percent or more of the
  leader's clicks; `'low'` when at most one page earns clicks; else `'medium'`.
- **Both converge and self-delete.** Rows with `status: 'detected'` that are no longer detected
  are deleted next run, so a page you fixed **disappears**: that is the success signal, and why
  you copy `peak_traffic`, `current_traffic`, `traffic_decline_pct` and
  `top_declining_keywords` into the PM task before shipping. Human-re-statused rows survive.
- **E-E-A-T covers the account's top 10 GSC pages, not the site.** Fetched live and LLM-scored
  under a 150-page-per-run fleet budget, with a heuristic fallback. Read `*_signals.method`:
  `'llm'` reflects the prose, `'heuristic_only'` only the presence of a byline, a contact link,
  an Article schema. `competitor_scores` is not computed. `overall_score` weights trust 0.35,
  expertise 0.25, experience 0.20, authority 0.20.
- **`seo_content_gaps` has no writer**, so expect `data: []` forever. Build gap analysis by hand
  (Play C4), and never tell a client the list is empty because there are no gaps.

Scoping quirks, verified against the routes:

- `seo_content_decay`, `seo_cannibalization` and `seo_featured_snippets` accept `project_id` but
  the routes **ignore it** and scope by account, so on a multi-site account filter each row's
  `domain` or `url` yourself. They cap at 30 rows (ordered by `traffic_decline_pct`,
  `traffic_loss_estimate`, `opportunity_score` desc) and MCP forwards none of their `domain` /
  `severity` / `status` / `limit` filters: **you get the worst 30 and nothing else**.
- `seo_eeat_scores` is the exception: it forwards `domain`, `url`, `is_ymyl`, `min_score`,
  `max_score`, `page`, `limit` (max 100). `seo_serp_features` forwards `keyword`
  (case-insensitive contains), ignores `project_id`, orders `checked_at` desc.
- `seo_serp_get` is the only metered call here: `keyword` (required), `location_code` (2840 =
  US), `language_code`, `device`. Never loop it.

**Local first.** `hiveku-data/seo/gsc_pages.json`, `gsc_queries.json`, `keywords.json`,
`rankings.json`, `tracked_keywords.json`, `competitors.json` and `audits.json` orient you at zero
cost; `hiveku-data/STATUS.json` carries the fetch timestamp. Older than the last material account
change is orientation only.

## 1. Decision frameworks

### 1.1 The portfolio model

Every URL is in one of five states and the monthly job is knowing the count in each:
**performing** (stable, correct intent), **decaying** (in `seo_content_decay`), **split** (in
`seo_cannibalization`), **weak** (indexed, thin or low E-E-A-T, impressions without clicks),
**absent**. Decaying and split are the cheapest wins: links, age and history already exist.
Budget by maturity: a mature site (150+ URLs, 10+ decay rows) runs roughly 60 percent refresh
and 40 percent new, a young site (under 40 URLs) 90 percent new. A net-new plan on a site with
30 severe decay rows is malpractice.

### 1.2 The five-way disposition

| Disposition | Choose when | Window |
|---|---|---|
| Leave | Stable top 3, or the decline is seasonal or SERP-layout driven | n/a |
| Refresh | Ranks 5 to 30 for its head term, decay row present, intent still matches | 2 to 6 weeks |
| Rewrite | Ranks 5 to 30 but `seo_serp_get` shows a different content type in the top 5 | 4 to 10 weeks |
| Consolidate | 2+ URLs on one intent, neither stable in the top 5 | 3 to 8 weeks |
| New | No URL of ours in the top 50 for the head term, or every existing URL serves another intent | 3 to 6 months |

Never create a second page on an intent you already cover: that manufactures a cannibalization
row you pay to fix next quarter.

### 1.3 Prioritization

```
recoverable = peak_traffic - current_traffic       # clicks per 28 days
effort      = 1 (metadata + internal links) | 2 (section rewrite) | 3 (full rewrite + assets)
priority    = recoverable * confidence * business_value / effort
```

`confidence`: 0.6 for `decay_type: 'traffic'` (freshness usually explains it), 0.4 for
`'position'` (something displaced you), 0.75 for `'both'` on a page untouched 12+ months, 0.2
once `seo_serp_get` shows the SERP changed shape. `business_value` is the client-confirmed 1 to 3
(do they sell this?). Cannibalization rows use `traffic_loss_estimate`, snippet rows
`opportunity_score`.

### 1.4 Sequencing

Out of order the work cancels itself: cannibalization first (refreshing one of two competing
pages just moves the split), then the decay cohort by priority score, then E-E-A-T on money pages
(template work), then snippet capture on top-10 pages, then net-new.

### 1.5 The refresh depth ladder

- **Tier 1 (1 to 2 hours):** title and meta rewritten against the current SERP, the H2s
  `top_declining_keywords` names, refreshed dates and statistics, 3 to 5 internal links from
  healthy pages. Expect 20 to 40 percent of `recoverable`.
- **Tier 2 (half a day):** plus 500 to 1500 words of new substance covering subtopics the top 3
  cover and you do not, plus schema and an answer block. Expect 40 to 70 percent.
- **Tier 3 (multi-day):** full rewrite against a new intent, new assets, SME quotes, new URL only
  if the old one is wrong (then a 301, never a delete). Top-decile `peak_traffic` only.

### 1.6 The cause test (before any refresh)

A decay row says clicks fell, never why. Five causes, four of which a rewrite does not fix.

1. **Staleness** - out of date versus the top 3. Refresh works, Tier 1 or 2.
2. **Displacement** - `seo_serp_get` shows a new domain in the top 3. Refresh plus links, slowly.
3. **SERP layout shift** - an AI Overview, carousel or local pack absorbs the clicks; position
   flat, CTR collapsed. Check `seo_serp_features` history and switch to feature capture or AEO.
4. **Intent shift** - the top 5 are a different content type. Rewrite, not refresh.
5. **Self-inflicted** - a redeploy changed the template, a noindex slipped in, a link block
   vanished. That is technical-seo.md; check the audit delta before blaming the copy.

The tell separating 1 and 2 from 3 and 4: `peak_avg_position` versus `current_avg_position`. Flat
with clicks down hard means the SERP changed around you; down 3+ means you were beaten.

---

## 2. The plays

### Play C1 - Weekly portfolio triage (about 10 minutes, zero metered calls)

1. `account_context_get({ domain: 'seo' })`. Re-read `instructions` before anything generative;
   note protected pages, the approval threshold, which pages are money pages.
2. `seo_content_decay({ project_id })`. Per row: `domain`, `url`, `decay_severity`,
   `decay_type`, `peak_traffic`, `current_traffic`, `traffic_decline_pct`, `position_decline`,
   `keywords_lost`, `top_declining_keywords[]` (`query`, `prior_clicks`, `current_clicks`,
   `prior_position`, `current_position`, `clicks_lost`), `refresh_priority`, `status`,
   `last_analyzed_at`. Filter to this client's `domain`; `last_analyzed_at` older than 8 days
   means the sweep skipped the account, so say so.
3. `seo_cannibalization({ project_id })`. Per row: `domain`, `keyword`, `page_count`,
   `competing_pages[]` (`page`, `clicks`, `impressions`, `avg_position`), `severity`,
   `traffic_loss_estimate`, `recommended_primary_url`.
4. `seo_task_list({ status: 'todo', task_type: 'seo' })`, then `task_type: 'content'` (the
   default is `'seo'`). Read `implementable` and `implement`.
5. Anything new at `decay_severity: 'severe'`, or cannibalization `severity: 'high'` on a money
   page, gets a task this week (`pm_tasks_create({ project_id, title, description,
   task_type: 'seo', priority })`); the rest queues for the monthly cohort.

### Play C2 - The refresh program (the play the retainer pays for)

1. Candidates from `seo_content_decay` (C1 step 2), 4 to 8 per month at a mid-tier retainer.
   Score with 1.3, keep the top N.
2. Cause test (1.6) on each survivor: one
   `seo_serp_get({ keyword, location_code: 2840, device: 'mobile' })` per page, on the highest
   `clicks_lost` query (mobile, because layout shifts show there first). Read who holds 1 to 3,
   their content type, which features are present. Discard causes 3 and 5, routing to C5 or
   technical-seo.md.
3. Brief each survivor: `talk_to_department({ domain: 'seo', message })` carrying the URL, the
   `top_declining_keywords` table verbatim, peak versus current numbers, the top-3 competitor
   outline, internal-link targets, schema, refresh tier, and the voice constraints from
   `account_context_get` (`domain: 'content'` when brand voice dominates). A brief without SERP
   evidence is a guess.
4. Persist with `content_create` (confirm its fields first; it is a write). Client sees the brief
   before the draft and the draft before it ships. Never let generated copy reach a live site
   unread: invented statistics and credentials are the standard LLM failure mode, and a fake
   credential on a YMYL page is a liability.
5. Ship. Hiveku-hosted sites go through the implement rail (Play C7) or the site tools in
   SKILL.md Play 3. Externally hosted sites get the brief plus exact copy blocks and their team
   ships: no tool edits a site Hiveku does not host.
6. Record ship date and before-numbers, then `pm_tasks_update` / `pm_tasks_complete`.
7. Measure at 28 days: the clean signal is the decay row vanishing after the next sweep, the
   numbers come from the GSC period tools (rankings-and-search-console.md) with a page filter.

### Play C3 - Cannibalization resolution

1. `seo_cannibalization({ project_id })`, filtered to the client's domain.
2. Per finding above threshold, `seo_serp_get({ keyword })`. One question: **same intent, or two
   legitimate pages that happen to share a query?** Long-tail queries pull in a category page and
   a guide all the time; that is coverage, not cannibalization.
3. Same intent, neither stable in the top 5: consolidate onto `recommended_primary_url` (the
   highest-click page, tie-broken by position). Merge the losers' substance in, 301 them,
   re-point internal links. Never delete without a redirect: that throws away the links.
4. Same intent, one page clearly winning (top 3, stable): leave it, and de-optimize the loser
   only if it draws impressions for the head term (retitle toward its own intent, do not gut it).
   Overlapping but distinct intents: retitle, re-angle H1 and intro, cross-link.
5. Consolidation is a redirect plus a content merge, so it needs explicit approval: name every
   source URL, the target, and the redirect type. Redirects are hard to unwind once cached.
6. `pm_tasks_create` per consolidation with the full URL list, then `memory_update` the SEO
   memory so a future session does not "discover" the merged page as a gap.

### Play C4 - Content gaps (no working tool; build it by hand)

`seo_content_gaps({ project_id, competitor_domain })` would return `missing_keywords`,
`content_opportunities` and `traffic_potential` ordered by `priority_score`, but nothing writes
the table. Call it once so you can honestly say you checked, then build the analysis: the
competitor intersection and ranked-keyword tools in link-building-and-competitors.md and
keyword-research.md are the real gap analysis, with volume and difficulty attached. Free
fallback: `web_map({ url: competitorDomain })` for their URL space, `web_crawl` or `web_extract`
on their content hubs for titles, H1s and publish dates, `web_search` for "topic + competitor",
then diff against `hiveku-data/seo/gsc_pages.json` and your sitemap: volume-blind, but honest.
Validate the top 10 with `seo_serp_get` first, since a SERP of national brands means re-scoping
to the long tail however big the gap looks. Output is a ranked gap list in the strategy
deliverable; gaps become tasks only once the client agrees they are worth writing.

### Play C5 - SERP features and featured snippets

1. `seo_featured_snippets({ project_id })`. Read `keyword`, `our_position`, `can_win_snippet`,
   `opportunity_score`, `snippet_type`, `snippet_holder_domain`, `required_content_type`,
   `required_format`, `target_word_count`, `question_to_answer`, `content_gap`, `our_url`,
   `status`. Empty is normal until an AEO audit has run for the domain (SKILL.md Play 7,
   aeo.md): run it, then come back, since this tool is a free DB read.
2. Qualify: only `can_win_snippet: true` **and** `our_position` 10 or better (snippets come from
   page one, mostly the top 5). `our_position: 34` is a ranking project, not a snippet one.
3. Verify the live format: `seo_serp_features({ keyword })` for persisted history
   (`features_present[]`, `featured_snippet`, `people_also_ask`, `ai_overview`,
   `we_have_featured_snippet`, `we_in_ai_overview`, `our_organic_position`, `checked_at`), plus
   `seo_serp_get({ keyword })` when the newest `checked_at` is over ~30 days old.
4. Write to the observed format: paragraph snippets take a 40 to 60 word answer immediately
   under an H2 restating `question_to_answer`; list snippets 5 to 8 short parallel items; table
   snippets a real HTML table. Answer block at the top of its section, never in a summary.
5. Ship via C2 step 5, then re-probe after the next AEO audit and report
   `we_have_featured_snippet` flipping true. Two probes 30 days apart before claiming a win.

### Play C6 - E-E-A-T remediation

1. `seo_eeat_scores({ domain, max_score: 65, limit: 100 })`. Read `url`, `overall_score`, the
   four dimension scores, the four `*_signals` objects, `is_ymyl`, `ymyl_category`, `issues[]`,
   `quick_wins[]`, `scored_at`.
2. Check `*_signals.method` first. On `'heuristic_only'` a low score means "signals missing",
   never "the writing is untrustworthy", and it is not an assessment you may quote to a client.
3. Triage by weight. Trust is 35 percent of the composite and cheapest to fix; `trust_signals`
   names what is missing (`contact_link`, `about_link`, `privacy_or_terms_link`,
   `phone_or_email`, `address_tag`, `modified_date`). Template fixes: one ticket, whole site.
4. Then `expertise_signals` (`author_name`, `meta_author`, `references_section`,
   `cite_elements`) and `authority_signals` (`schema_author`, `article_schema`, `external_links`,
   `published_date`). A credentialed byline plus Article and Person schema moves three at once.
5. `is_ymyl: true` raises the bar: `overall_score` under 60 is urgent and a missing credentialed
   author is the first fix, before any copy work.
6. The sample is 10 pages re-scored roughly every 28 days: do not extrapolate to the site, do not
   expect a re-score the day after you ship, and say "the 10 pages we have scores for". File with
   `pm_tasks_create`, template fixes as one task each.

### Play C7 - The implement rail (SEO task to deployed code)

1. Hiveku-hosted sites only, and only where the PM project is bound to a website project.
   `seo_task_list({ status: 'todo', task_type: 'seo' })`, then `'content'`. Read `implementable`.
2. `seo_task_get({ task_id })`. Read `description`, `ai_instructions`, the resolved `page_url`,
   the linked website project, `implementable`, and the rail summary (`session_id`,
   `dispatched_at`, `approved_at`, `deployment_id`). Unresolved `page_url` means the agent edits
   the wrong file: fix the task first.
3. `seo_task_implement({ task_id })` **without** `confirm`. It dispatches nothing and returns
   `{ requires_confirm: true, preview }` with task, target project, domain and page anchor: show
   that preview verbatim.
4. On an explicit yes, repeat the identical call with `confirm: true` (strict boolean); this
   spends a paid agent turn. Only open tasks (todo, queued, blocked, need_info) dispatch; a
   running session 409s, an already-deployed task 409s, an exhausted AI budget 402s.
5. Poll `seo_task_implement_status({ task_id })`. Phases: `idle`, `running`,
   `awaiting_approval` (staged deploy, token and expiry in the response), `deploying`,
   `completed` (`deployed_at`, `deployment_url`, task auto-completed at deploy time), `failed`
   (`stage: 'agent' | 'deploy'` with the error).
6. **Do not approve the staged deploy yourself.** Hand the summary and expiry to the user to
   approve in their SEO workspace or the dashboard approval rail.
7. On `failed`: `agent` means the instruction was unusable (usually a missing `page_url`, or a
   task written as a wish), so rewrite `ai_instructions` and re-dispatch; `deploy` means the
   build broke, which is technical-seo.md.

---

## 3. Thresholds and benchmarks

Act on: decay `'severe'` (60 percent+) on any page with `peak_traffic` 20+ clicks per 28 days;
decay `'moderate'` on a money page; `position_decline` 5.0+ (investigate displacement before
assuming staleness); cannibalization `severity: 'high'`, `traffic_loss_estimate` 20+ clicks per
28 days, or `page_count` 3+; snippets with `can_win_snippet: true` and `our_position` 10 or
better; `overall_score` under 60 on YMYL or under 50 on a money page, `trust_score` under 50
anywhere as a template fix; any money page moving 20 percent+ week over week, same-day.

Queue only: decay `'mild'` (next cohort, Tier 1) and cannibalization `severity: 'low'`, where
one page earns the clicks and the split is cosmetic.

Sizing (never promises): 4 to 8 pages per cohort, 2 to 3 if each is Tier 3; a consolidation
returns 60 to 90 percent of `traffic_loss_estimate` once the redirect settles, in 3 to 8 weeks;
snippet capture shows 1 to 4 weeks after re-crawl. Recovery per tier is in 1.5, time-to-signal in
1.2, the CTR curve and difficulty bands in SKILL.md. Four strong pages a month beats twelve thin
ones: thin pages become next year's decay rows.

---

## 4. Diagnosis

**Every content tool returns empty.** In order: look for the `note` field, since decay and
cannibalization say "no analysis exists yet" when the result is unanalyzed rather than clean, so
empty with no note means analyzed and clean; check Search Console is connected with a `site_url`
exactly matching the property string (`sc-domain:` and url-prefix are not interchangeable, and a
mismatch produces silent empties); check there are 42+ days of archive; check a Sunday has passed
since connection (the sweep is bounded to 500 accounts per run, so a new account can miss a
cycle). `seo_content_gaps` empty never resolves; empty `seo_featured_snippets` or
`seo_serp_features` means no AEO audit has run for this domain.

**A page you know is dying is not in the decay list.** The floors exclude it: under 100 prior
impressions or 5 prior clicks, decline under 25 percent, or outside the top-100-per-account cap.
Small and new pages are structurally invisible here; verify with the GSC page-filtered tools.

**Numbers do not match the client's own Search Console.** Expected: the windows are two archived
28-day spans anchored at the last archived day, not the last 28 days from today; GSC lags 2 to 3
days; the archive is query x page x day, so summing across dimensions double-counts. Explain the
window instead of adjusting the number.

**`implementable: false` on a task you can see.** The PM project is not bound to a website
project, and binding is a dashboard action with no MCP tool. Also check it is not a subtask:
`pm_tasks_create` force-flips `task_type` to `'subtask'` whenever `parent_task_id` is passed, and
the rail queue filters to `'seo'` or `'content'`, so a task filed under a parent vanishes from
`seo_task_list` entirely. Create SEO and content tasks flat.

**`seo_task_implement` returned success and nothing happened.** Poll
`seo_task_implement_status` before believing any dispatch: this rail has a documented history of
reporting success on a dispatch that never created an agent turn. `phase: 'idle'` after a
confirmed dispatch means the turn did not start. Do not re-dispatch blindly; escalate.

**A refresh shipped and the metric will not move.** In order: was the page re-crawled; has 28
days passed; was the cause actually content (re-run 1.6); did a competitor ship at the same time
(`seo_serp_get`); did the ship change the URL, canonical or internal links.

---

## 5. Edge cases and failure modes

- **Do not touch a stable top-3 page.** Refresh programs lose more traffic to over-optimized
  winners than they gain from mild-decay pages. Not in the decay list, not in the cohort.
- **A vanished decay row is not proof the refresh worked.** Rows also vanish when the page falls
  below the 100-impression floor, which is decay completing, not reversing.
- **Do not delete pages in a consolidation.** 301 them, or you discard the backlinks that made
  the page worth consolidating. And `recommended_primary_url` is only the highest-click page in
  one 28-day window, which can be a seasonal outlier: sanity-check it.
- **Do not bulk-apply anything.** No mass retitling, no mass redirects, no publishing a cohort
  in one shot, no looping a metered call. Every write is named and confirmed individually (exact
  URLs, changes, redirect targets) and nothing client-facing goes out without a yes. Protected
  pages and approval thresholds from `account_context_get` are read-only to you.
- **Do not promise snippet capture:** snippets oscillate, can be removed from a SERP entirely,
  and are increasingly displaced by AI Overviews.
- **Do not paper over a dead integration.** With no GSC connection the honest deliverable is "we
  cannot see decay, cannibalization, E-E-A-T or query data until this is fixed", plus a task to
  fix it.

## 6. Persistence and reporting

**Memory.** Durable decisions go to the SEO domain memory: refresh cadence and cohort size, the
consolidation map (which URLs merged into which, and when), pages declared off-limits, intent
verdicts per cluster, and any conclusion that cost a metered call. Check `memory_list` first: it
is one document per account and project, so `memory_create({ type: 'memory', name: 'seo',
content })` returns 409 once it exists and you `memory_update` the merged body instead. Losing
this is how the next session rebuilds a page you deliberately redirected.

**PM tasks.** One task per shippable unit, flat (never `parent_task_id`), `task_type: 'seo'` or
`'content'`. The description carries the before-numbers from the decay or cannibalization row,
the disposition and tier, the target keywords, and the acceptance criterion. `pm_tasks_update`
for status, `pm_tasks_complete` on ship with the live URL and date. An analysis without tickets
is a PDF, not a service.

**Client reporting.** The content section of the monthly report (reporting-and-delivery.md)
carries: pages refreshed with before and after clicks and ship dates; consolidations with the URL
map; snippet wins with probe dates; E-E-A-T fixes scoped to the pages actually scored; the next
cohort with expected impact and its window. Every number must be reproducible from a named tool
call, and a missing capability (no gap-analysis table, no GSC connection, a site you cannot deploy
to) is stated, not quietly omitted.
